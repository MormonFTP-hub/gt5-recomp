# GT5 Recomp

An unofficial PC port of **Gran Turismo 5** (PS3) made by static recompilation: the game's
PowerPC and SPU code is translated into C++ that is compiled for Windows x64, and the PS3's graphics,
sound, input and system calls are reimplemented on Windows (Direct3D 12 for the RSX). A native
[Linux build](#linux) (Vulkan) is new and early.

It is built on [ps3recomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/ps3recomp) and borrows from the
[GT5 Prologue port](https://github.com/sp00nznet/GT5P), both by Ned Heller (sp00nznet).

> **Game version required:** your own **Gran Turismo 5** Blu-ray disc, using the disc's own
> executable (version **01.00**, with **no game update** installed):
>
> - **Europe, BCES00569**: tested. This is the copy the port was built from.
> - **North America, BCUS98114**: works; players have raced on it (thanks!). The lift finds the few addresses
>   that differ between releases in your own executable.
>
> See [Which copy of GT5](#which-copy-of-gt5) for how to check your files.

<a id="install"></a>

## ⬇️ Install

**The easy way, on Windows 10 or 11:**

1. Download **[GT5-Installer.bat](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/releases/latest/download/GT5-Installer.bat)**
   and double-click it. If Windows warns about a downloaded file, choose **Run** (or **More info**, then
   **Run anyway**).
2. In its window, pick two things and press **Install**:
   - **your GT5 game**: the folder of your disc dump (the one with `PS3_GAME` in it) or an `.iso`;
   - **PS3UPDAT.PUP**, Sony's free PS3 system software (the window has a button that opens Sony's page).

That's all. It installs whatever's missing (Git, Python, Microsoft's C++ build tools), downloads this
code, unlocks your game's executable and the system software with RPCS3 (used only as a tool for that:
the game itself runs natively as `gt5.exe`, not in an emulator), builds the game (about an hour the
first time) and puts **Gran Turismo 5 (PC)** on your desktop, which opens the [launcher](#launcher).
Nothing from the game is ever uploaded or shared.

Rather do it by hand? See [Setup](#setup). On Linux? See [Linux](#linux).

<a id="launcher"></a>

## 🎛️ The launcher

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/launcher.png" alt="The GT5 launcher: Display settings, with a big Play button" width="80%">
</p>

**Gran Turismo 5 (PC)** on your desktop (or `GT5Launcher.exe` in your `gt5-recomp` folder) opens the
launcher: every setting in one window, then **Play**. No more editing `play.bat`.

- **Display:** 1080p or 720p, **Speed** (30 fps draws every other frame; it only helps when the graphics
  card is the limit, the window title then shows both numbers, e.g. `FPS: 15 (game 30)`), screen shape
  (ultrawide), **borderless full screen**, maximized or a window size, watch mode, SPU threads.
- **Controls:** steering wheel on/off, wheel rotation, force feedback strength and direction, pad in the
  background, mouse clipping.
- **Game:** the game's language (as far as your disc has it), your mods from `GT5\mods`, the launcher's
  own language (English or 中文).
- **Updates:** shows your version and the newest one with what's new, and **Update now** does the
  whole update for you and opens the launcher again.
- **Help:** **Save logs for a report** puts your logs on the desktop as `.txt` files GitHub accepts,
  plus the logs folder, the problem form, this FAQ and **Clear the shader cache** (also
  `ClearShaders.bat` in the install folder; see the FAQ).

It's built on your PC from [`launcher/GT5Launcher.cs`](launcher/GT5Launcher.cs) with the C# compiler that
comes with Windows, every time the game is built, so it updates with the game; its picture is the logo
from your own disc. Settings are saved in `GT5\settings.bat`, which `play.bat` reads, so `play.bat`
still works and starts the game the same way. (`GT5Launcher.exe --play` starts the game straight away.)

<a id="updating"></a>

## 🔄 Updating

Every change to the port comes out as a numbered version (v0.1.0, v0.1.1, ...) on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/releases), with what changed. To hear
about new ones, click **Watch** at the top of this page, then **Custom** and tick **Releases**.

### The easy way

- **The launcher** checks for a new version when it opens: its **Updates** page shows what's new, and
  **Update now** does everything below and opens the launcher again.
- Or **double-click `Update.bat`** in your `gt5-recomp` folder.

Both run `update.ps1`, so everything below applies. (No launcher or `Update.bat` yet? Your next update
brings them: run the command below once.)

### Are you out of date?

Close the game, open PowerShell in your `gt5-recomp` folder and run:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File update.ps1 -List
```

It lists every version and marks the one you have (`<- installed`) and the newest (`[newest]`).
If they're different, you're out of date.

### Update to the newest version

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File update.ps1
```

That one command does everything:

1. It downloads the new version.
2. It swaps the old ps3recomp patch for the new one.
3. It re-generates the game code only if that version needs it (about 10 minutes).
4. It rebuilds only what changed.

Kept as they are:
- your saves (`GT5\gamedata`), a game update's data (`GT5\hdd0`) and game files (`GT5\input`, `GT5\vfs`, `GT5\dev_flash`);
- the shader cache;
- edits you made to files such as `play.bat`.

The previous `gt5.exe` is kept as `GT5\build\gt5.previous.exe`. If one of your edits clashes with a
change in the new version, the new version's file is used and your edit is saved in `backups\` so
you can copy it back.

**If you're several versions behind,** run the same command. It goes straight to the newest version;
there's no need to step through the ones in between.

### Installed before update.ps1 existed?

If your folder has no `update.ps1` (you set up before v0.1.0), get it first, then update:

```
git pull
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File update.ps1
```

If `git pull` says your local changes would be overwritten (usually `play.bat`), run `git stash`,
then `git pull`, then `git stash pop`, then the update. Your first update re-generates the game code
once (about 10 minutes), because older installs have no record of what their code was made from.

### Downloaded the ZIP instead of cloning?

A ZIP download can't update itself. Clone the repository fresh as in [Setup](#setup), step 1. Then
move these folders over from your old copy and run `update.ps1`:
- your game files: `GT5\input`, `GT5\vfs`, `GT5\dev_flash`;
- your saves: `GT5\gamedata` (and `GT5\hdd0`, if you set up a game update).

### Go back to an older version

If a new version gives you trouble, switch back to the one that worked (see `-List` for the names):

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File update.ps1 -Version v0.1.0
```

To play the previous build right away instead, copy `GT5\build\gt5.previous.exe` over
`GT5\build\gt5.exe` (the last update kept it). Please also
[report what went wrong](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=2-problem.yml).

### Other options

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `update.ps1 -Dev` | The newest changes, before they're released. |
| `update.ps1 -NoBuild` | Switch versions without building; build later with `GT5\scripts\build.cmd gt5`. |
| `update.ps1 -Force` | Re-generate and rebuild everything, even when nothing changed. |

<a id="controls"></a>

## 🎮 Controls

A DualSense, DualShock 4 or XInput pad works. Without one, the keyboard:
Z = Cross, X = Circle, A = Square, S = Triangle, arrow keys = D-pad, Enter = Start, Tab = Select.

A steering wheel works too, with force feedback (new; one real wheel tried so far): see the
[FAQ](#faq).

## 📋 Current state

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/status.png" alt="Playable: 45 to 58 fps in races on an i9-14900KF and RTX 4070 Ti SUPER" width="100%">
</p>

**Playable.** Races run at 45 to 58 fps on the tested rig, and most of the game's modes work. The full
board (tested rig, what works, what's being worked on, known issues, recent changes) is in
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md); updates are also posted in
[Announcements](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/discussions/categories/announcements).
Everything done on the port since the first day, with dates, is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🏁 Try it, then tell me how it went

If you own the game, please set it up and play. Every result helps decide what gets fixed next,
whether it runs great, half works, or doesn't build at all. Laptops, integrated graphics and AMD cards
especially: the port was tuned on one desktop with an NVIDIA card.

## ❓ FAQ

| Question | Short answer |
|---|---|
| Steering wheels? | 🧪 New. First real wheel: a Genius Speed Wheel 3 Vibration (`0458:3017`, tested by brocolison, [#29](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/pull/29)) attaches as an emulated G27; since 13 Nov it's found by itself and its one-axis pedals work as throttle and brake (a full race on v0.1.39). Logitech, Thrustmaster and Fanatec wheels are picked up by themselves but still untried: [wheel owners wanted](#faq) |
| Force feedback? | 🧪 New, with wheel support, also untried on a real wheel |
| Widescreen (16:9)? | ✅ Yes, GT5 is a 16:9 game |
| Ultrawide (21:9, 32:9)? | ✅ New: a wider view, with the HUD kept 16:9 in the middle |
| Which controllers? | ✅ DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox pads, keyboard |
| US copy (BCUS98114)? | ✅ Yes, players have raced on it |
| Version 1.02, or a game update (2.xx)? | 🧪 New: game updates run: 2.17 (the last) tested on the US and European releases, 2.01 on the Asian one, 2.11 with the Master Mod on the US one by a player ([how to set one up](#game-updates)); 1.02 untried |
| Settings without editing files? | ✅ New: the [launcher](#launcher) |
| Full screen? | ✅ New: borderless full screen in the launcher (Alt+Enter is switched off since v0.1.17: it used to freeze the picture) |
| Higher than 1080p (4K)? | ⚠️ The game's top mode is its 1080p one (races drawn at 1728x972), scaled up to your window; drawing above that isn't there yet |
| Japanese or Asian release (BCJS, BCAS)? | ✅ Hong Kong / Asia (BCAS20108) runs, reported by a player, and its disc 01.00 and update 2.01 race in tests too; Japanese untried, please report |
| Slow PC or laptop? | 🛠️ Laptops now use their dedicated graphics card. On most PCs the CPU sets the pace (the game's own threads), so the launcher's **Speed: 30 fps** rarely helps: it's for a graphics card at its limit. **On a laptop:** plug it in and set Windows' power mode to *Best performance* (and the maker's performance mode, e.g. in HP Command Center or Lenovo Vantage): a tester's i5-1135G7 ran into its power limit 88% of the time, which held its cores at 2.9 GHz instead of 4.2, while its graphics were only 30% busy. Speed-ups for 4-6 core CPUs are being worked on |
| Linux? | 🧪 New and early: a [native Linux build](#linux). First test (no graphics card) reached the race start; races on a real GPU untested |
| Steam Deck, Proton, Wine? | 🟡 Steam Deck: the Linux build in a distrobox runs (menus ~25-30 fps, races ~8-10; [Steam Deck](#steam-deck)). Proton and Wine not tried. Reports welcome |
| Android? | 🛠️ Being worked on |
| Online? | ❌ No |
| Is it legal? | ✅ No game files here: you build it from your own disc |
| Ready-made download? | ❌ No, but [GT5-Installer.bat](#install) builds it for you |
| Errors during setup? | 🛠️ Use [GT5-Installer.bat](#install), or run `setup.ps1` (see below) |
| Black screen, `draws: 0`? | 🛠️ Fixed: update; if it's still black, `GT.VOL` may be missing or in pieces (see below) |
| Clear or refresh the shaders? | ✅ New: launcher **Help > Clear the shader cache**, or double-click `ClearShaders.bat` (see below) |

**Q: Does it support steering wheels and force feedback?**

**A: Yes, new in v0.1.2, and one real wheel has been tried so far.** On a PS3, GT5 talks to its
Logitech wheels directly over USB, for both steering and force feedback. The port now plays that
part: your PC wheel appears to the game as a **Logitech G27** (900°, three pedals, paddles and an
H-shifter), and the game's force-feedback commands (the centring spring, the steering forces in a race)
are played on your wheel through DirectInput, which Logitech, Thrustmaster, Fanatec and other wheels
support. Plug the wheel in before you start the game; it's picked up by itself, and pads work as before.

What has been checked, without a wheel: the game accepts the emulated G27, a race steers from it, and
the force-feedback commands the game sends are decoded and logged.

The first real wheel (thanks to brocolison, [#29](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/pull/29)):
a **Genius Speed Wheel 3 Vibration** attaches as the G27, and the game sends it its wheel commands in a
race. It has no force feedback, and both pedals sit on one axis. Since 13 Nov the port finds it by
itself (Windows calls it a joystick, so before that it needed `set "PS3_WHEEL=0458:3017"`) and splits
that axis where it rests: one way is throttle, the other is brake. If they're the wrong way round:
`set "PS3_WHEEL_PEDALS=throttle=Yinv"`. Other wheels with pedals on one axis get the same. On v0.1.39
brocolison raced a full 16-car field with it, throttle and brake both working, with the keyboard for
the menus (that wheel has no d-pad). A pad or the keyboard works alongside any wheel.

What hasn't been checked: force feedback on a real wheel, including which way the forces push. So
**wheel owners are wanted**: please
[tell us how it went](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=1-tried-it.yml)
(or [report a problem](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=2-problem.yml)),
and attach `GT5\logs\play.err`: its `[wheel]` lines say which wheel was found, its axes, and what the
game asked of it.

If something is off, add a line to `play.bat` (next to the other `set` lines):

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| The forces push the wrong way (the wheel pulls away from the centre) | `set "PS3_WHEEL_FFB_INVERT=1"` |
| Forces too strong or too weak | `set "PS3_WHEEL_FFB=60"` (percent, 0 = off) |
| Steering too quick or too slow | set your wheel's rotation to 900° in its software (G HUB, ...), or tell the port what it is: `set "PS3_WHEEL_RANGE=1080"` |
| A pedal does nothing, or the wrong thing | `set "PS3_WHEEL_TRACE=1"`, press each pedal, and see which axis moves in the `[wheel] axes` lines of `play.err`; then e.g. `set "PS3_WHEEL_PEDALS=throttle=Y,brake=RZ,clutch=Z"` (add `inv` to one that works backwards: `brake=RZinv`) |
| Throttle and brake swapped on a wheel whose pedals share one axis | `set "PS3_WHEEL_PEDALS=throttle=Yinv"` (`play.err` names the shared axis: `[wheel] throttle and brake share the Y axis`) |
| A button is wrong | `set "PS3_WHEEL_BUTTONS=cross=1,circle=3,start=10"`, with button numbers as Windows' *Set up USB game controllers* window (`joy.cpl`) shows them; names: cross square circle triangle r1 l1 r2 l2 select start r3 l3 gear1..gear6 gearr plus minus dialcw dialccw |
| The wrong device is used, or none | `set "PS3_WHEEL=G29"` (part of its name, or its `046d:c24f` VID:PID); `play.err` lists every controller it saw |
| You don't want it | `set "PS3_WHEEL=off"` |

Buttons and pedals are set up for Logitech's G29 / G923 / G920 out of the box; other wheels steer and
get force feedback the same way but may need the pedal and button lines above.

**Q: Does it support widescreen and ultrawide?**

**A: Yes, both; ultrawide is new.** GT5 is a 16:9 game, so a normal widescreen monitor (1920×1080,
2560×1440, 4K) is filled edge to edge, as on a PS3. On an ultrawide monitor (21:9 or 32:9) the game now
draws a wider picture itself: races and replays show more of the track at the sides (nothing is
stretched), the 3D scenes behind the menus widen the same way, and the HUD and menus stay a 16:9 block
in the middle of the screen. `play.bat` sets `PS3_ASPECT=auto`, the shape of your monitor; the window
opens at that shape, so maximize it or drag it to the size you like.

| In `play.bat` | What you get |
|---|---|
| `set "PS3_ASPECT=auto"` | the shape of your monitor (the default; on a 16:9 monitor nothing changes) |
| `set "PS3_ASPECT=21:9"` (or `32:9`, `3440x1440`, `2.37`) | that shape, whatever the monitor |
| `set "PS3_ASPECT=16:9"` | the PS3's own 16:9 picture, as before |
| `set "PS3_WINDOW_SIZE=2560x1080"` | the window opens at exactly that size (and shape, unless `PS3_ASPECT` says otherwise) |

The game draws 720 lines at the wider shape, as many pixels across as it needs up to 1920: about
1700×720 for 21:9, as sharp as its usual 1280×720. Shapes wider than 8:3 (32:9) are drawn at 1920×720
and spread sideways to fill the window, so they're a little softer side to side. The window title shows
the size it draws at. This works on the European release (BCES00569, disc 01.00); on any other release
the picture stays 16:9 for now, and `logs\play.err` says so in a `[widescreen]` line.

**Q: What resolution does it render at?**

**A: GT5's own 1080p mode, as on a PS3 connected to a 1080p TV, scaled to fit your window.** Races are
drawn at 1728×972 (the game keeps a black border around them for TVs that cut off the edges), the HUD
and menus at 1920×1080. Choose it in the [launcher](#launcher) (Display, Resolution), or in `play.bat`:

| In `play.bat` | |
|---|---|
| `set "PS3_VIDEO_MODE=1080"` | the 1080p mode (the default since v0.1.12) |
| `set "PS3_VIDEO_MODE=720"` | the 720p mode, races at 1152×648: for a slow graphics chip |

On the tested rig both run at the same speed, since the CPU is the limit; on a laptop's built-in
graphics 720 may be faster, but often the CPU is the limit there too (an Iris Xe laptop's graphics were
30% busy at 1080p). (v0.1.10 had the 1080p mode on too, but its window showed only the top-left
part of the picture; v0.1.11 went back to 720 until v0.1.12 fixed it.) On an ultrawide monitor the 720p
mode draws the wider view pixel for pixel (about 1700×720), and the 1080p mode draws it into 1920×1080
and spreads it sideways. Rendering above the PS3's resolutions is on the list.

**Q: Which controllers work?**

**A: DualSense and DualShock 4 (USB or Bluetooth), Xbox and other XInput pads, and the keyboard.** See
[Controls](#controls) for the keyboard layout.

**Q: Can I use a US copy?**

**A: Yes.** Players have raced on the US disc. Its executable has the same layout as the European one,
and the tools find the few spots that could differ between releases in your own copy anyway (see
[Which copy of GT5](#which-copy-of-gt5)). Only ultrawide is still Europe-only.

**Q: My copy says version 1.02, or I have a game update (2.xx). Does that work? What about the Master Mod?**

**A: Game updates work now, as far as they've been tried.** 2.17, the last update, runs on the US
release (menus, GT Mode and a full 16-car Arcade race at 60 fps) and on the European one (its first-start
questions, the opening movie, Arcade and a 16-car race). The Asian release's 2.01 boots,
loads a career save and races. An update needs two things from your PS3 (or RPCS3): its executable
and its data, see [Game updates](#game-updates).

**The GT5 Master Mod runs too** (Nenkai's, 1.9.2 on update 2.11, US release; a player's report on
13 Nov): its boot screen, the menus, its SELECT debug menu and an A-Spec race. Set it up like an
update: install 2.11 and the mod in RPCS3, copy the data, and use the mod's `EBOOT.BIN` as the
executable (`setup.ps1` unlocks it from RPCS3's `dev_hdd0` by itself since v0.1.35). The data alone,
with the disc's executable, gives a black screen before the main menu.

The Asian 2.17 hasn't been tried yet: each update can change the game's SPU programs again, so please
report what setup prints (`version_addrs.py`'s lines and `SPU jobs found in EBOOT.elf: N of 15`; 2.17
shows 13 of 15 plus 3 of its own, and that is complete). Another disc version, like 1.02, hasn't been tried either; the same lines tell us how
close it is.

**Q: Does online work?**

**A: No.** GT5's online services were shut down, and the port doesn't connect to anything.

**Q: Is there a ready-to-go build I can just download?**

**A: No, and there can't be.** A built `gt5.exe` contains GT5's own code converted for PC, so
sharing one would be sharing the game itself. That's what gets projects like this taken down, and
it's why this one only works from your own disc. Please don't ask for builds or share them. What we
can do is make building easy: [GT5-Installer.bat](#install) asks for your game and Sony's PS3 system
software file and does all the rest, ending with a shortcut on your desktop. If you get stuck, post its output in the
[discussions](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/discussions) and someone will help.

**Q: I get errors like "venv\Scripts\python.exe is not recognized" or "cannot find analysis\version.json". What's wrong?**

**A: Setup hasn't finished, so the tools that later steps use aren't there yet.** `venv` is the Python
environment `setup.ps1` makes. `analysis\version.json` is made by the build itself from your EBOOT.elf,
so it isn't a file you add. Open PowerShell in the `gt5-recomp` folder (the one with `setup.ps1`, not
`GT5\scripts`) and run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1`. It installs what's
missing, lists any of your files that are missing or in the wrong place, and once everything is there
it generates and builds the game for you. If Python itself is missing, install Python 3.11 or newer
from python.org with "Add python.exe to PATH" ticked, then run setup again.

**Q: The game starts but the window stays black, and the title says `draws: 0`. What's wrong?**

**A: Builds made before 10 November did that; it's fixed.** Setup didn't compile the game's SPU code
(the PS3's co-processors), so the game waited forever for work that never ran. Update and it's
rebuilt with that code: in the `gt5-recomp` folder run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File update.ps1`
(or double-click `setup.bat`; if you downloaded the ZIP, download it again and move your `input`,
`vfs` and `dev_flash` folders into the new `GT5` folder). While it builds, it prints
`SPU jobs found in EBOOT.elf: N of 15`.

**Still black on a new version?** Look in `GT5\logs\play.err` for `open FAIL '/dev_bdvd/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/GT.VOL'`.
That means the game's data file, `GT.VOL` (about 12 GB), isn't in `GT5\vfs\PS3_GAME\USRDIR`. Dumps made
to a FAT32 USB drive split it into pieces (`GT.VOL.66600`, `GT.VOL.66601`, ...); since v0.1.19 they're
joined automatically by `Update.bat`, setup and the launcher's **Play**. If there's no `GT.VOL` at all,
copy it from `PS3_GAME\USRDIR` in your dump. Otherwise attach the whole `GT5\logs\play.err` to a
[problem report](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=2-problem.yml), with
that line.

**Q: The picture froze on one screen, but the menu sounds still react when I press buttons. What now?**

**A: Restart the game, and send us the log of the frozen run.** The game kept running; only the picture
stopped. Before v0.1.17, **Alt+Enter** always did this (Windows switched the window to exclusive full
screen behind the port's back); it's switched off now, so update, and use the launcher's **borderless
full screen** for full screen. If it froze without Alt+Enter, the graphics driver most likely reset or
refused a frame. (A frozen opening movie at the first start, the Earth from space, was another cause;
since v0.1.21 that movie is skipped.) Attach that run's log to
[issue #10](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/10), with your graphics card: it's
`GT5\logs\play.err` until you start the game again, then `GT5\logs\play.prev.err` (each start keeps the
previous log under that name; builds before v0.1.10 didn't, so there copy `play.err` before restarting). A
line in it starting with `[d3d-fail]` says what failed, and that decides the fix.

**Q: How do I attach my log to an issue? GitHub won't take it.**

**A: Rename it first.** GitHub refuses `.err` files, so rename `GT5\logs\play.err` to `play.err.txt` (or put
it in a `.zip`) and drag it into the issue. The installer's `GT5-Installer.log` attaches as it is. For a
graphics problem, also say the mode, the track and its time or weather (for example Arcade, Chamonix,
snow): some problems show on one track and not another.

**Q: How do I clear the shader cache?**

**A: Launcher, Help, Clear the shader cache, or double-click `ClearShaders.bat` in your install
folder (close the game first).** The game turns each of GT5's shaders into a PC shader the first time
it's needed and keeps the result in `GT5\scratch\rsx_shader_cache_v2` (on Linux `GT5/shadercache`), so
the next visit doesn't stutter. Clearing it frees the space (it grows with every car and track you
see) and gives a fresh start; the first visit to each menu, car and track then stutters again for a
while. It can't fix or cause a wrong picture: a cached shader is only used for exactly the same
source, so a game update, a mod or a new version of the port never picks up an old one by mistake.
Saves, settings and game files are not touched. On Linux, delete `GT5/shadercache` by hand.

**Q: Is this legal? Do I need the game?**

**A: You need your own copy of GT5, and nothing from the game is in this repository.** It holds only
code written for the port. You build the game yourself from your own disc, and builds must never be
shared (see below).

<a id="linux"></a>

## 🐧 Linux

A native x86-64 build using Vulkan and SDL2. See [Requirements](#requirements) for hardware and
build dependencies, and [Which copy of GT5](#which-copy-of-gt5) for supported game releases.

**Experimental:** menus have been tested with software rendering; races on a real Linux GPU are
still untested. See [Linux testing status](#linux-testing-status).

### Set it up

After cloning, run all commands from `gt5-recomp`. Replace `/path/to/...` with your own paths.

**1. Install the build dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp
cd gt5-recomp
bash setup.sh --install-deps
```

`--install-deps` installs packages using apt, dnf, pacman or zypper and may ask for your password.
Without it, setup prints the install command. Three `[missing]` game-file entries are normal on
the first run: the next steps supply them.

**2. Prepare the firmware with RPCS3**

Download and open the Linux AppImage from [RPCS3 downloads](https://rpcs3.net/download).
RPCS3 is a free PS3 emulator, used here to extract firmware and decrypt the game executable.
You can close it once those jobs are done.

Download `PS3UPDAT.PUP` from [Sony's PS3 system software page](https://www.playstation.com/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/).
In RPCS3, choose **File > Install Firmware** and select that file. Once installation finishes,
copy the extracted firmware:

```bash
mkdir -p GT5/dev_flash
cp -a ~/.config/rpcs3/dev_flash/. GT5/dev_flash/
```

If RPCS3 stores `dev_flash` elsewhere, use that location instead.

**3. Copy the game data**

Copy the whole `PS3_GAME` folder from your disc dump:

```bash
mkdir -p GT5/vfs/PS3_GAME
cp -a "/path/to/your/disc/PS3_GAME/." GT5/vfs/PS3_GAME/
```

**4. Decrypt the game executable**

In RPCS3, choose **Utilities > Decrypt PS3 Binaries** and select your disc dump's
`PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN`. Copy the decrypted output to `GT5/input/EBOOT.elf`:

```bash
mkdir -p GT5/input
cp "/path/to/decrypted/EBOOT.elf" GT5/input/EBOOT.elf
```

Use the file produced by decryption; renaming the encrypted `EBOOT.BIN` does not decrypt it.
For a game update, follow [Game updates](#game-updates-2xx) to keep the executable and data matched.

**5. Check and build**

Check these paths exist, without an extra `dev_flash` or `PS3_GAME` folder nested inside:

```text
GT5/dev_flash/sys/
GT5/input/EBOOT.elf
GT5/vfs/PS3_GAME/PARAM.SFO
GT5/vfs/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/GT.VOL
```

Check the files and build only if the check succeeds:

```bash
bash setup.sh --no-build && bash setup.sh
```

If setup reports `[missing]`, follow its message and rerun the command.
The first build takes about 20 to 60 minutes and produces `GT5/build-linux/gt5`.

### Play

```
bash GT5/play.sh
```

Logs go to `GT5/logs` (`play.err` is the one to attach to a report). Settings: the switches in
`GT5/play.sh` (full screen, resolution, watch mode), or your own `export NAME=value` lines in
`GT5/settings.sh`, which win and survive updates.

Full screen, kept across updates (thanks, melroy89):

```bash
echo 'export PS3RECOMP_VK_FULLSCREEN=1' >> GT5/settings.sh
```

Or just once: `PS3RECOMP_VK_FULLSCREEN=1 bash GT5/play.sh`.

Controls: any controller SDL2 knows (DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox, 8BitDo, the Steam Deck's own
controls through Steam Input), or the keyboard as on Windows: Z = Cross, X = Circle, A = Square,
S = Triangle, Q/W = L1/R1, 1/2 = L2/R2, arrows = D-pad, Enter = Start, Tab = Select, Esc = quit.

### Updating

```
git pull
bash setup.sh
```

It re-patches ps3recomp, re-generates the game code only when the new version needs it, and rebuilds
only what changed. Your saves (`GT5/gamedata`, `GT5/hdd0`) and game files stay.

### Linux testing status

**How far it's been tested (12 Nov 2026):** on Ubuntu 24.04 with no graphics card at all (Mesa's
software Vulkan driver, on a virtual display), so speed and the picture on a real GPU are untested.
`setup.sh` ran the whole setup from a fresh clone: tools, ps3recomp, the game code (the same code the
Windows setup generates, checked file by file) and the build. The game boots, does the first-start
screens and saves them, and reaches the top menu with its 3D scene, GT Mode (My Home), and Arcade
through track select, car select (the 3D car), colour and the pre-race screen with the 3D track.
**The race itself stayed black** in that test. The same race does draw with this renderer on a real
graphics card (checked on Windows), so that was the software driver.

**First test on a real graphics card (13 Nov 2026, melroy89, [#20](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/20)):**
Linux Mint 22.3, Threadripper 7960X, Radeon RX 7900 XTX. `setup.sh` and the build went through, the
menus draw correctly, an Xbox controller works out of the box, and there were no crashes or frame drops.
Still wrong there at first: races drew in the top half of the picture, the intro's 3D scene looked
white, and sound effects played late. The squashed races and the late sound are fixed since 13 Nov
(see the changelog); the white city is how GT5 draws that scene.

If you have a Linux PC with a graphics card, please
[tell us how it goes](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=1-tried-it.yml)
(attach `GT5/logs/play.err`).

### Not there yet on Linux

- No launcher and no installer: setup is `setup.sh`, settings are in `play.sh` / `settings.sh`.
- Steering wheels and force feedback (Windows only so far).
- Ultrawide (21:9, 32:9): the Linux renderer draws 16:9.
- The Vulkan renderer is younger than the Windows one; picture bugs the Windows build fixed may
  still show here. Please report them with a screenshot.
- The title screen's white model city is meant to be white (the Windows build draws it the same),
  but its depth-of-field blur and darker roads may still be missing on Linux.
- Movies and the on-screen keyboard (naming a save, Course Maker) are untried on Linux.

<a id="steam-deck"></a>

### Steam Deck

**Tried on a Steam Deck OLED** (SteamOS 3.9, update 2.17 with DLC, the build in an Arch distrobox;
the Ubuntu box below is the same route): it builds, boots, races and plays sound in time. More reports
welcome. The route is the Linux build in a distrobox. SteamOS keeps its system files read-only, so `setup.sh` can't install the build tools there
(it says so and stops). Distrobox, part of SteamOS 3.5 and later, gives you an Ubuntu container that
shares your home folder, screen, sound and graphics. In desktop mode, in Konsole:

```
distrobox create --name gt5 --image ubuntu:24.04
distrobox enter gt5
git clone https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp
cd gt5-recomp
bash setup.sh --install-deps
```

(`sudo` inside the box needs no password.) Then copy your files in as above and run `bash setup.sh`
again, still inside the box. Keep `gt5-recomp` on the internal drive: it needs about 30 GB. The first
setup is slow on the Deck's 4 cores: expect one to two hours for generating the code and building
(an estimate; it runs one compile per 2 GB of free memory).

To play from Game Mode: in desktop mode, Steam > *Add a Non-Steam Game*, browse to
`/usr/bin/distrobox-enter`, and in its properties set the launch options to
`-n gt5 -- bash /home/deck/gt5-recomp/GT5/play.sh` (setup prints the exact line). Started from
Steam, the Deck's controls reach the game as a controller; from a terminal they act as mouse and
keyboard. Leave full screen off in `play.sh`: Game Mode fits the 16:9 window onto the 16:10 screen
with bars, while full screen would stretch it.

Play from Game Mode. In desktop mode Steam's desktop controller layout turns the Deck's buttons into
keys, and the menu button becomes Esc, which quits the game.

What to expect, measured on the Deck: the main menu at about 25-30 frames a second and races at about
8-10 (100-130 ms a frame). GT5's pace is set by the CPU: in a race the GPU is mostly idle (locking its
clock at 1600 MHz changed nothing), and the game's own threads set the frame rate. The first races
after an update recompile their shaders once and stutter. B-Spec races and replays in watch mode
(`export LD_WATCH=1` in `GT5/settings.sh`) are the realistic use. Suspend and resume are untested:
quit the game first.

The Windows build under **Proton** is untried too. Direct3D 12 would go through vkd3d-proton; start
`GT5\play.bat` (it sets the game's switches), not `gt5.exe` on its own.

<a id="requirements"></a>

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Windows:** Windows 10 or 11 (x64) and a Direct3D 12 graphics card. Build with Visual Studio 2022
  with *Desktop development with C++* and *C++ Clang tools for Windows*, or use the
  [standalone tools](#no-visual-studio).
- **Linux (experimental):** an x86-64 distribution with FFmpeg 6.1 or newer (such as Ubuntu 24.04
  or Linux Mint 22), and a Vulkan-compatible GPU with a Vulkan driver. Follow the
  [Linux setup](#linux) to install build dependencies and prepare the game.
- An AVX2-capable CPU and 16 GB of RAM for the first build.
- Python 3.11 or newer, and Git.
- About 25 GB free on Windows or 30 GB on Linux, including about 17 GB of game files.
- Your own GT5 disc (BCES00569, BCUS98114 or BCAS20108) and the means to dump it, and
  [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/download) to install PS3 firmware and decrypt the game's executable.

<a id="no-visual-studio"></a>

### No Visual Studio? (less space on C:)

Visual Studio puts several GB on C:. `get-toolchain.ps1` gets the same compiler tools without it, all in
one folder you choose, on any drive. In the `gt5-recomp` folder, in PowerShell:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File get-toolchain.ps1
```

- It suggests a `toolchain` folder next to `gt5-recomp`. Type another folder to put it somewhere else,
  for example on a second drive.
- It downloads about 1.5 GB and keeps about 1.5 GB: LLVM 19.1.5 (clang-cl), CMake and Ninja from
  their official GitHub pages, and Microsoft's C++ libraries and Windows SDK, fetched from Microsoft by
  [mmozeiko's portable-msvc.py](https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko). Every download is checked.
- Microsoft's part comes under Microsoft's licence. The script shows you the link and only goes on when
  you type `yes`.
- No administrator rights, and nothing is installed into Windows. To remove the tools, delete the folder.

Then run `setup.ps1` as usual (it also offers to run `get-toolchain.ps1` when it finds no Visual Studio).
When there's no Visual Studio, the build uses these tools.

<a id="which-copy-of-gt5"></a>

## Which copy of GT5

Use the Blu-ray disc's own executable, `PS3_GAME\USRDIR\EBOOT.BIN`, application version **01.00**
(the `APP_VER` in `PS3_GAME\PARAM.SFO`), or the executable of a game update together with that
update's data (see [Game updates](#game-updates)).

| Release | Title ID | Status | SHA-1 of the disc's files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Europe / PAL | **BCES00569** | tested | `EBOOT.BIN` `1FFABF4C029CF3099579B73425C91C1FD48CAFCA`, decrypted `EBOOT.elf` `1535B865EC7DD58E7704B378B8621532ECF844E1` |
| North America | **BCUS98114** | works (run by players) | decrypted `EBOOT.elf` `40126D2D14B0A95B9601BB11E3A6E778186067AC` |
| Hong Kong / Asia | **BCAS20108** | tested (and run by a player) | decrypted `EBOOT.elf` `49A3662D4B541BB4E0C2E72D2602F89FEB710E71` |
| Hong Kong / Asia, update 2.01 | **BCAS20108** | tested: menus, career save, Arcade race | decrypted update `EBOOT.elf` `96DEA35B194AA80E993CAD9EBE42E96072F3A3D5` |
| North America, update 2.17 | **BCUS98114** | tested: menus, GT Mode, 16-car Arcade race | decrypted update `EBOOT.elf` `12EF249F9B95591E08251AC85F103B1451DA23BF` |
| Europe, update 2.17 | **BCES00569** | tested: first-start questions, opening movie, 16-car Arcade race | decrypted update `EBOOT.elf` `306F86C62B9F03041C903BE96AC59E5C3F130452` |

Almost everything in the port works for any release, because the recompiled code is generated from
your own executable. Only three things are tied to where the code sits in one executable: the end of
the code, the game's setjmp/longjmp routines, and one jump table the game builds while it runs.
`GT5\scripts\relift.ps1` starts by running `GT5\scripts\version_addrs.py`, which finds all three in
your EBOOT by what the code looks like, not by address, and prints your EBOOT's SHA-1:

- If every line is found, carry on: your release should work.
- If it prints `NOT FOUND`, that release differs in those places. Please open an issue with that
  output (the text only, never any game file).

Check a file's hash with `Get-FileHash <file> -Algorithm SHA1` in PowerShell.

<a id="game-updates"></a>

### Game updates (2.xx)

A game update brings a new executable and data the game reads from the PS3's hard disk (for 2.01,
about 2.2 GB of files in `PDIPFS`). The port needs both:

1. **Get the update's files**: install the update in [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net) (*File > Install
   Packages/Raps/Edats* with the update's `.pkg`), or copy the game's folder from your PS3's hard disk.
   Either way they're in `dev_hdd0\game\<title ID>\USRDIR` (for example `dev_hdd0\game\BCES00569\USRDIR`).
2. **The executable**: decrypt that folder's `EBOOT.BIN` (RPCS3, *Utilities > Decrypt PS3 Binaries*) and
   save the result as `GT5\input\EBOOT.elf`. The disc's `PS3_GAME` stays as it is in `GT5\vfs`.
   **Don't skip this step.** With the update's data but the disc's executable, the game stops before
   the main menu (a black screen). `setup.ps1` (and `Update.bat`) now does it for you when it can: it
   finds the update's `EBOOT.BIN` in `GT5\hdd0\game\<title ID>\USRDIR` or in RPCS3's `dev_hdd0` (a mod
   that comes with its own `EBOOT.BIN` puts it there too), unlocks it with RPCS3, and keeps the disc's
   as `GT5\input\EBOOT.disc-01.00.elf`. If your RPCS3 isn't found, set `GT5_RPCS3` to its `rpcs3.exe`,
   or do this step by hand.
3. **The data**: copy everything else in that `USRDIR` folder (`PDIPFS` and the rest, not `EBOOT.BIN`)
   to `GT5\hdd0\game\<title ID>\USRDIR`, keeping the folder names. Without it the game starts, but
   Arcade Mode has no courses to choose.
4. Run `setup.ps1` again: it lifts and builds the new executable (about an hour).

If your disc folder's `PS3_GAME\PARAM.SFO` already says version 02.xx, it holds the update's
executable, but usually not its data: step 3 is still needed. `GT5-Installer.bat` doesn't do these
steps yet.

<a id="dlc"></a>

### DLC

GT5's DLC works once it's installed, with update 2.17 (tested on the US release): the Racing Car
Pack, Car Packs 2 and 3, the 2012 car packs, the Course Pack, Speed Test, Twin Ring Motegi and the
gift cars. Each DLC item is a small "voucher" file the game unlocks it from; the cars and tracks
themselves come with the updates. Only DLC you bought unlocks: a voucher opens only with the key of
its licence.

1. **The vouchers**: install the DLC `.pkg` files in RPCS3 (*File > Install Packages/Raps/Edats*), or
   use your PS3's hard disk, and copy `dev_hdd0\game\<title ID>\USRDIR\vou` to
   `GT5\hdd0\game\<title ID>\USRDIR\vou`.
2. **The licence keys**: for each voucher, the 16-byte key of its licence, saved as
   `GT5\hdd0\home\00000001\exdata\<content ID>.rifkey`. The content ID is the name of the licence
   file (`<content ID>.rap`), for example `UP9000-BCUS98114_00-TWINRINGMOTEGI00`. The key comes from your
   licence; this repository holds no keys and doesn't make it for you.
3. Start the game. The gift cars arrive in the garage at the first start ("The following Gift Cars have
   been added to your garage"); the packs are in **Downloadable Content** on the main menu, under
   Purchased Content, each with *Install*. That screen wants a PSN sign-in: when `play.bat` finds
   vouchers, it tells the game it's signed in, with a local profile and no connection to anything.

A voucher without its key stays locked, and the game shows nothing for it.

<a id="setup"></a>

## 🚦 Setup

**`setup.ps1` does almost everything.** Run it as often as you like. Each time it does what's still
to do, checks your files, and tells you exactly what's missing and how to fix it. Once everything is
in place it builds the game for you. You never need to run the scripts in `GT5\scripts` yourself.

1. Install the tools from [Requirements](#-requirements): Git, Python 3.11 or newer (tick "Add
   python.exe to PATH"), and Visual Studio 2022 with C++ and the Clang tools.
2. Get the port and run setup once. In PowerShell:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp
   cd gt5-recomp
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
   ```

   Or, without typing commands: after the `git clone`, double-click **`setup.bat`** in the
   `gt5-recomp` folder. It runs the same setup and keeps the window open so you can read the result.

   It fetches and patches ps3recomp, makes the Python environment and downloads FFmpeg. Then it lists
   the game files you still need to add, marked `[missing]`. Use Git rather than the ZIP download, so
   you can update later.
3. Add your own game files (setup checks each one and catches the usual mistakes):
   - **Game data:** dump your own GT5 disc (BCES00569 or BCUS98114) and copy its `PS3_GAME` folder to
     `GT5\vfs`, so that `GT5\vfs\PS3_GAME\USRDIR` exists.
   - **System software:** in RPCS3, install the PS3 firmware (File > Install Firmware, with
     `PS3UPDAT.PUP` from Sony). Then copy RPCS3's `dev_flash` folder to `GT5\dev_flash`, so that
     `GT5\dev_flash\sys` exists.
   - **The executable:** in RPCS3, Utilities > Decrypt PS3 Binaries, choose your disc's
     `PS3_GAME\USRDIR\EBOOT.BIN`, and save the decrypted file as `GT5\input\EBOOT.elf`. It must be the
     decrypted one: setup tells you if it's still encrypted.
4. Run setup again (the same command, or double-click `setup.bat`):

   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
   ```

   When nothing is missing, it generates the game code from your EBOOT.elf (about 10 minutes) and
   builds `gt5.exe` (20 to 50 minutes the first time, depending on your PC).
5. Play: `GT5\play.bat`. Saves go to `GT5\gamedata`; logs go to `GT5\logs`.

If setup stops with an error, post its whole output in the
[discussions](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/discussions) or the
[problem form](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=2-problem.yml).

When it is set up, the folder looks like this (the parts you add are marked):

```
gt5-recomp\
  setup.bat, setup.ps1, update.ps1, README.md, LICENSE
  ps3recomp\          fetched and patched by setup.ps1
  ffmpeg\             fetched by setup.ps1
  venv\               made by setup.ps1
  GT5\
    input\            YOU ADD: EBOOT.elf (decrypted)
    vfs\PS3_GAME\     YOU ADD: the PS3_GAME folder from your disc
    dev_flash\        YOU ADD: from RPCS3 after installing Sony's firmware
    generated\, src\gen\, analysis\   made by setup.ps1 from your EBOOT.elf
    build\            made by setup.ps1 (gt5.exe)
    hdd0\, logs\      made when you play
```

Optional, for speed: GT5 runs many SPU jobs. They run in an interpreter until they are captured and
recompiled. Run the game once with `SPU_DUMP_MISS=<GT5 folder>\analysis\spu_miss` set, then run
`python GT5\scripts\lift_spu_jobs.py` and build again (see the comments at the top of that script).

<a id="switches"></a>

## ⚙️ Switches

`play.bat` sets the usual environment variables, then reads `settings.bat` (what the launcher saves),
so the launcher's settings win. Some useful ones:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PS3_VIDEO_MODE=1080` | The game's 1080p mode (default); `720` for its 720p mode on a slow graphics chip. See the [FAQ](#faq). |
| `PAD_BACKGROUND=1` | The pad keeps working when another window has focus. |
| `PS3_WHEEL=off` | Don't look for a steering wheel. The other `PS3_WHEEL_*` settings are in the [FAQ](#faq). |
| `LD_WATCH=1` (or **F9** in the game) | Watch mode for B-Spec races and replays: draws every other frame while the race keeps full speed, draws nothing while minimized, and lowers the game's priority. Off unless you turn it on; with `LD_WATCH=1` it comes on after 10 s without input and goes off when you touch the controls. |
| `PAD_CURSOR_CLIP=1` | Keep the mouse inside the window while the controller is in use (the old behaviour). By default the mouse is free, and only the mouse movement and clicks Steam makes from the controller are ignored. |
| `GCM_DRAIN_STAT=1` | Timing lines every 5 s in `logs\play.err`. |
| `PS3_MUTE=1` | No sound. |
| `RSX_SHADER_CACHE_DIR=<dir>` | Where compiled shaders are cached (default `scratch\rsx_shader_cache_v2`). |
| `LD_ASYNC_SHADERS=0` | Compile new shaders one at a time on the graphics thread, as before 13 Nov, instead of on up to 8 threads alongside it. |
| `GT5_MOD_<NAME>=1` | Turns on a game-code mod from `GT5\mods` (see [MODDING.md](MODDING.md)). |

Most speed-ups in the patch can be switched off one by one to rule them out when something looks
wrong; each is described in a comment next to its `getenv` in the patch.

## ⚖️ What this repository contains, and what it does not

This repository holds only code and scripts written for the port:

- `GT5/patches/ps3recomp.patch`: the changes to ps3recomp (runtime, graphics, SPU, audio, input).
- `GT5/CMakeLists.txt`, `GT5/play.bat`, `GT5/src/`, `GT5/config/`: the GT5 build and launcher.
- `GT5/scripts/`: the lift, build, test and analysis tools.

It does **not** contain, and must never be given:

- any part of the game: the EBOOT, disc or installed files, music, textures, models, shaders,
  menu images, save data, or screenshots;
- code generated from the game (the recompiled `generated/` and `spu/` folders, `src/gen/`): every
  user produces these from their own copy;
- PS3 firmware, system modules, or any decryption key.

You need your own copy of Gran Turismo 5 (BCES00569 or BCUS98114), dumped from a console you own, and PS3 system
software installed from Sony's official update file. Use this only with games you own.

- **Never share what you build.** `gt5.exe`, the `generated/` folder and anything else made by the
  lift contain code recompiled from the game, so each person has to build them from their own copy.
  Don't upload them or a ready-to-play package, and don't ask for them.
- This repository does not include, link to, or explain how to obtain decryption keys or game files.
- Questions about downloaded copies of the game will not be answered.

**Gran Turismo** is a trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment. This project is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or connected to Sony Interactive Entertainment or Polyphony Digital.

## 🔧 Fork it, mod it

Forks are welcome; take whatever you like (MIT license). If you make something good, open a pull
request or [show it here](https://github.com/MormonFTP-hub/gt5-recomp/issues/new?template=4-my-fork-or-mod.yml)
so it can come back into the main repo. [MODDING.md](MODDING.md) covers the ways in: switchable
game-code mods in `GT5\mods`, the graphics, controller and sound code, and the tools for finding
your way around. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the few rules.
